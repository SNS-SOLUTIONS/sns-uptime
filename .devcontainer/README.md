## Frontend

Since the frontend is using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), all changes in this area will be hot-reloaded.
You don't need to restart the frontend, unless you try to add a new frontend dependency.

## Backend

The backend does not automatically hot-reload.
You will need to restart the backend after changing something using these steps:

1. Click `Terminal`
2. Click `Codespaces: server-dev` in the right panel
3. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server
4. Press `Up` to run `npm run start-server-dev`
